0. Hello world- > Write a script that prints “Hello, World”, followed by a new line to the standard output.
1. Confused smiley- > Write a script that displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.
2. Let's display a file : A script that displays the content of the /etc/passwd file.
3. What about 2? : A scipt that displays content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.
4. Last lines of a file : A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd.
5. I'd prefer the first ones actually : A scipt that displays the first 10 lines of etc/passwd.
6. Line #2 : A script that displays the third line of the file iacta.
       The file iacta will be in the working directory and you are not allowed to use sed.
